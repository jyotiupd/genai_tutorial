DNA contains the instructions for the synthesis of proteins, which are essential for the structure and function of cells. Additionally, DNA is responsible for the transmission of genetic information from one generation to the next. Therefore, every cell in our body needs DNA to carry out its specific functions and to maintain the integrity of the organism as a whole.'"
