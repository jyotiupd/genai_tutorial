# Tree of Thought Puzzle Solver Demo

This repo implements a Sudoku puzzle solver based on our proposed Tree-of-Thought (ToT) framework, a novel approach aimed at improving the problem-solving capabilities of auto-regressive large language models (LLMs). The ToT technique is inspired by the human mindâ€™s approach for solving complex reasoning tasks through trial and error. In this process, the human mind explores the solution space through a tree-like thought process, allowing for backtracking when necessary. To implement ToT as a software system, we augment an LLM with additional modules including a prompter agent, a checker module, a memory module, and a ToT controller. In order to solve a given problem, these modules engage in a multi-round conversation with the LLM. Unlike an auto-regressive LLM which generates a new token based on the preceding sequence of tokens without backward editing, the ToT framework allows the sytem to backtrack to the previous steps of the thought-process and explore other directions from there.

## Setup

Clone this repo and install the required dependencies (Python 3.9+ required):

```shell
git clone https://github.com/jieyilong/tree-of-thought-puzzle-solver
cd tree-of-thought-puzzle-solver
pip install -r requirements.txt
touch config.yaml
```

Edit the YAML file `config.yaml`, paste in the following content and save. Then, please set your choice of model (e.g. "gpt-3.5-turbo") and your OpenAI API Key:

```yaml
chatbot:
    type: "openai"
    max_context_length: 8000
    include_chat_history_in_query: false
openai:
    model: <model_name>
    api_key: <your_open_ai_api_key>
```

## Run ToT

```shell
python run_tot.py "<problem_description>"

# Example
python run_tot.py "please solve this 4x4 sudoku puzzle [[*,1,*,*],[*,*,2,*],[*,*,*,4],[1,*,*,*]] where * represents a cell to be filled in."
```

## Run Experiments

```shell
# solver_type: zero_shot, one_shot_with_cot, few_shot_with_cot, tot
python run_expr.py <solver_type> <path/to/problem/set/json>

# Example
python run_expr.py zero_shot data/benchmarks/sudoku/3x3_sudoku_puzzles.json
